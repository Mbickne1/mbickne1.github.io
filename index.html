		<h2>My Experience</h2>
		<p>Through my studies at Eastern Michigan University I have worked with different programming languages and learned alot about the fundamentals of programming, through courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Discete Math,
		Software Engineering Solutions, Applied Cryptogrophy, and Algorithm Design and Analysis. I have worked alot with Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and am currently working on expanding my experience with Python, Visual Studio, and C++.
		Outside of class I enjoy working out and staying healthy, working at my part-time job, and expanding my knowledge of Computer Science. Throughout college I have worked as a Server/Manager at a restaurant in my home town, giving me
		experience working with customers and providing great service, working with my co-workers as a team to provide a great night out to our patrons, as well as managing the schedules and conflicts of other employees, and all the other 
		responsibilites that come with managing a popular restaurant.</p>
